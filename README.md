# Python-RTMP server 2

This is an improvement over the old python rtmp server, now it has a subscript that runs whenever a stream is published. The script shows the incomign stream(being saved as an flv). The script is closed on stream end and the .flv is deleted. Future goal is to make this stream accessable from a webapp
